    <h3> Smart Elevators </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> OOP,Java</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The project focuses on the challenge of optimizing elevator scheduling.
      Given a call for the elevator from the source floor to the destination floor - the system will want to schedule the elevator that will minimize the arrival time. More generally, it is said that given a collection of calls to elevators in time, we would like to define a strategy for assigning elevators to calls that will minimize the total arrival time for all the calls.</p>

    <p>This project is a Graph analayzing project which allows us to insert graphs, create graphs, changing graphs and study them. </p>
    <!-- <p>Not only will this tool allow you to check real stocks’ actual prices and portfolios’ values, it will also let you buy (okay, “buy”) and sell (okay, “sell”) stocks by querying IEX for stocks’ prices.Learnt to develop with flask, including the use of API (for the stocks info and prices)</p> -->

    <h3> Knowledge Base </h3>
    <p> This obsidian vault contains a lot of the notes that I have taken and materials I've accumulated during my degree's courses. When starting my degree, one ambition of mine was to open-source as much as I can from it so that many different people can profit from it. This is an ongoing project that will forever grow as I continue to learn new things.</p>

    <h3> Directed Graphs Algorithms </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Algotithms, UI, Graphs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The goal of this project is to design and implement two key interfaces:
      <ul>
        <li> Weighted directed graph interface.</li>
        <li> Weighted directed graphs algorithms interface.  </li>
      </ul>
      And also to represent the graph in an interactive graphical interface (matplotlib/drawGraph) that will introduce the algorithms.</p>
